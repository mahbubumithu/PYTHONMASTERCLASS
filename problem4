Write a calculator program that takes three inputs from the user:
1. Input1: A number (float or integer)
2. Input2: A number (float or integer)
3. Operator: A character representing a nathenatical operation. The operator can be one of the following : +, -, *, /, or %.

The program should perform the following tasks:
- Validate the inputs to ensure that Input1 and Input2 are valid numbers and that the Operator is one of the specified character.
- Use conditional statements to determine which operation to perform based on the Operator provided.
- If the operator is + , return the sum of Input1 and Input2
- If the operator is - , return the difference between  Input1 and Input2.
- If the operator is * , return the product of Input1 and Input2.
- If the operator is / , return the quotient of Input1 divided by Input2. If input2 is zero ,  return an appropritate error message indicating that division by zero is not allowed.
- If the operator is %, return the remainder of Input1 devided by Input2
- Display the result of the operation to the user.
