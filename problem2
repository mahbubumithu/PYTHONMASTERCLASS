Write a Python program that takes an input of average marks from the user and then categorizes the grade as follows:
- If marks are greater than or equal to 90, the grade is "A+"
- If marks are less than 90 but greater than or equal to 70, the grade is "A-"
- If marks are less than 70 but greater than or equal to 50, the grade is "B"
- If marks are less than 50, the grade is "Fail"
